This code is not fully accessible because it relies solely on mouse clicks for interaction.

We should adjust the code to support keyboard navigation (e.g., using Tab to focus, Enter to toggle).

The onClick event is attached to div elements instead of interactive elements like buttons, making 
it difficult for assistive technology to interact with them. We could add an ARIA role like role="button"
to them, but in some cases, this is not quite enough. Also, it might be a pain to maintain role="button" 
divs because you have to manually implement all the accessibility that comes built-in to the <button> tag.

So let's change the divs to buttons.
