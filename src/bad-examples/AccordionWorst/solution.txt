This code is not fully accessible because it relies solely on mouse clicks for interaction.

We should adjust the code to support keyboard navigation (e.g., using Tab to focus, Enter to toggle).

The onClick event is attached to div elements instead of interactive elements like buttons, making 
it difficult for assistive technology to interact with them. We could add an ARIA role like role="button"
to them, but this is not quite enough. So let's change the divs to buttons.
